# Christy's Portfolio
Welcome to my Portfolio Repository! This is where the magic happens. I used Angular 11 to create this so you would need to download Angular 11, then you can clone and type in `npm install` to install the node modules, then `ng serve -o` into your terminal and it will open up on `http://localhost:4200/`. If you would like to see the site this code created, click below!
